# iamthelabhras' Git Practice Repo

## "One of the best pieces I ever got was get good at Git.  After weeks of writing the perfect code, you submit a pull request and end up with a bunch of embarassing failed checks and merge conflicts.  Next thing you know, you're scrambling on Stack Overflow looking for a solution that will likely just add gasoline to the fire.  Git was created by a guy much smarter than us.  He knew if he made it too easy it would make us weak.  Instead, he wanted to give us the glory of overcoming the challenge."
